This is a basic implementation of a neural network on C++. 
I've done this for study programing. For compile this do you will need the Eigen library and a compiler with openMP configured.
Also, this comes with some exemple of input and output applied by this network, the input data comes from of Andrew. Ng machine learning course.
If there is one bug or error, I did like be advised by:)
